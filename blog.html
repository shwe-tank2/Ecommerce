                <h4>Woollen Cardigan With Dress</h4>
                <p>This has to be the oldest and classic sweater design in existence. Cardigans are one of the most versatile winter wear pieces that you can have. Even though you can wear a cardigan with almost any outfit, there is no match for the cardigan-with-dress look. If you wear a plain dress, go for a printed, well-fitted cardigan that reaches your waist. For a printed dress, wear a plain cardigan in a color picked out from the dress pattern. If you want to wear it with a form-fitting dress, or for a loger, jacket style cardigan in a neutral color. Wear woolen stockings to keep your legs warm and opt for high heralded calf-length boots

                <h4>Knit Sweater With Jeggings</h4>
                <p>Knit sweaters reek of class and sophistication. Be it a V-neck, round neck, or a drop shoulder design, the texture remains one of the most fashionable choices. Depending on your personal style, choose a color that stands out and looks luxurious and rich. Most high-end brands are coming up with neutral shades that are appropriate for all occasions and go with multiple outfits. Wear a drop shoulder, oversized knit sweater with fitted jeggings in navy blue or black. This look goes best with flat boots in black or brown. To add even more oomph to this look choose thigh-high boots. If the sweater is muted and subtle, add a colorful knit muffler and a matching cap to add a pop of color.
